# Sprint 01 Planning
**Chrome Extension: Smart Follow-up Suggestions for ChatGPT**

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goal
**Build MVP foundation**: Core follow-up generation engine + basic UI integration[2][6]

**Duration**: 2 weeks (Sept 12 - Sept 26, 2025)

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint Capacity
**Team**: Solo developer  
**Available Hours**: 40 hours (20 hours/week)  
**Risk Buffer**: 20% (8 hours for unknowns/debugging)

## ðŸŽ« Selected User Stories

### Story #1: Extension Infrastructure [8 hours]
**As a developer**, I want Chrome extension scaffold set up, so I can start building features  
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create manifest.json (Manifest V3) - 2h
- [ ] Set up content script injection for ChatGPT - 3h  
- [ ] Basic popup UI for settings - 2h
- [ ] Test extension loading/reloading workflow - 1h

### Story #2: ChatGPT Response Detection [6 hours]  
**As a user**, I want the extension to detect when ChatGPT finishes responding, so follow-ups can appear automatically  
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Research ChatGPT DOM structure and response events - 2h
- [ ] Implement response completion detection - 3h
- [ ] Add error handling for edge cases - 1h

### Story #3: Basic Follow-up Generation [12 hours]
**As a ChatGPT user**, I want contextual follow-up suggestions after each response, so I can continue conversations faster  
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design follow-up prompt template - 2h
- [ ] Implement ChatGPT API call for follow-up generation - 4h  
- [ ] Parse and format follow-up responses - 3h
- [ ] Add basic language detection - 3h

### Story #4: UI Button Integration [8 hours]
**As a user**, I want follow-up buttons above the input area, so they're easily accessible  
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Design button component (HTML/CSS) - 3h
- [ ] Inject buttons into ChatGPT interface - 3h
- [ ] Implement click-to-populate input functionality - 2h

### Story #5: Basic Testing & Polish [6 hours]
**As a developer**, I want core functionality tested and stable, so the MVP works reliably  
**Tasks**:
- [ ] Manual testing across different conversation types - 2h
- [ ] Fix critical bugs and edge cases - 3h  
- [ ] Basic performance optimization - 1h

## ðŸ”§ Technical Decisions

### Architecture Approach
- **Content Script**: Main logic injection into ChatGPT pages
- **Background Script**: Minimal - only for extension lifecycle
- **Storage**: Chrome.storage.local for user preferences
- **API Strategy**: Reuse ChatGPT's existing session/model[2]

### Key Technical Risks
1. **ChatGPT DOM Changes**: Interface updates could break detection
   - *Mitigation*: Use multiple detection strategies, robust selectors
2. **Rate Limiting**: Too many follow-up requests might trigger limits  
   - *Mitigation*: Add request throttling, user toggle
3. **Model Context Loss**: Follow-up requests might lose conversation context
   - *Mitigation*: Include recent conversation history in prompts

## ðŸ“Š Definition of Done
- [ ] Extension loads successfully in Chrome
- [ ] Detects ChatGPT response completion 90%+ of time
- [ ] Generates 3+ relevant follow-up suggestions
- [ ] Buttons appear and populate input correctly
- [ ] No console errors in normal usage
- [ ] Basic privacy compliance (no external data)

## ðŸš€ Sprint Deliverables
- Working Chrome extension (.crx file)
- Basic follow-up generation for English conversations
- UI integration that doesn't break ChatGPT interface
- Foundation for Sprint 02 advanced features

## ðŸ“… Key Milestones
- **Day 3**: Extension infrastructure complete
- **Day 7**: ChatGPT integration working  
- **Day 10**: Follow-up generation functional
- **Day 14**: MVP testing and bug fixes complete
