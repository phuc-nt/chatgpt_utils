# ADR-001: Core Architecture Decisions for Smart Follow-up Extension

**Status**: Approved  
**Date**: 2025-09-12  
**Deciders**: Solo Developer  

## Context

Building a Chrome extension that generates intelligent follow-up suggestions for ChatGPT conversations requires several critical architectural decisions that will impact the entire project lifecycle.[1][3]

## Decision Areas

### 1. Follow-up Generation Strategy

**Decision**: Use ChatGPT's existing model within the same conversation context to generate follow-ups

**Alternatives Considered**:
- External API (OpenAI API with separate context)
- Pre-defined template system
- Local NLP model

**Rationale**:
- Leverages full conversation context automatically
- No additional API costs or rate limits
- Perfect language matching with ongoing conversation
- Maintains privacy by staying within user's existing ChatGPT session
- Eliminates context synchronization complexity

### 2. UI Integration Approach

**Decision**: Inject follow-up buttons above ChatGPT's input textarea

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Sidebar panel
- Floating overlay
- Browser popup
- Below response area

**Rationale**:
- Maintains natural conversation flow
- User can see suggestions before typing
- Non-intrusive to existing ChatGPT interface
- Easy click-to-populate interaction pattern
- Responsive positioning regardless of screen size

### 3. Privacy & Data Handling Architecture

**Decision**: Complete local processing with zero external data transmission

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cloud-based analysis service
- Anonymous analytics collection
- Hybrid local/cloud approach

**Rationale**:
- Core competitive advantage over existing extensions
- Eliminates privacy concerns for enterprise users
- No server infrastructure or maintenance costs
- Compliant with strictest data protection requirements
- Faster processing (no network latency)

## Technical Implications

### Implementation Strategy
- **Content Script**: Primary logic injection into ChatGPT pages
- **Manifest V3**: Modern Chrome extension standard
- **DOM Observation**: MutationObserver for response detection
- **Session Reuse**: Leverage existing ChatGPT authentication/context

### Performance Constraints
- Follow-up generation must complete within 2 seconds
- Memory footprint kept under 50MB
- No blocking of ChatGPT's native functionality

### Extensibility Considerations
- Modular prompt template system for easy customization
- Language detection pipeline for multi-language support
- Toggle system for user preference management

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ Unique value proposition vs. existing extensions
- ✅ Zero privacy concerns enable enterprise adoption
- ✅ Context-perfect suggestions due to model reuse
- ✅ No external dependencies or API costs
- ✅ Fast time-to-market with minimal complexity

### Negative
- ❌ Dependent on ChatGPT's interface stability
- ❌ Cannot work offline or with other AI models
- ❌ Follow-up quality limited by ChatGPT's context window
- ❌ Potential rate limiting if overused

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: ChatGPT UI changes break integration
  - *Mitigation*: Robust DOM selectors + fallback detection methods
- **Risk**: Hidden prompt consumption affects user's token usage
  - *Mitigation*: User toggle + transparent prompt disclosure
